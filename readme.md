# Commercial Calendar Webpage

A responsive, full-screen interactive almanac built with **HTML5**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. This project replicates the classic "Commercial Almanac" aesthetic—popular in the Philippines and other regions—characterized by bold primary colors, chunky typography, and integrated tidal and lunar data.

## 🌟 Features

- **Retro Almanac Design:** High-contrast layout featuring the iconic Red, Blue, and White primary color palette found in traditional printed calendars.
- **Dynamic Calendar Engine:** Automatically calculates day placements, month lengths, and year transitions without external libraries.
- **Real-time Moon Phases:** Integrated algorithm that approximates lunar phases (New Moon, Waxing/Waning, Full Moon) for every day of the year.
- **Manila Tide Predictions:** Displays estimated High and Low tide times specifically tuned for Manila Bay, Philippines.
- **Dual Theme Support:** Seamless switching between "Vintage Paper" Light Mode and "Midnight Slate" Dark Mode.
- **Print-Perfect Optimization:** A dedicated CSS print engine that forces landscape orientation and removes UI elements for a clean, edge-to-edge physical print.
- **Fully Responsive:** Adaptive layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid to prevent text overlap on mobile devices while maintaining a wide, expansive view on desktop.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5
